<!--This function accesses the 2 inputs games and teamName and grabs their value and stores it to JavaScript variables.
After finishing the logic within the function you assign the variable output to the html p tag with the id (or name) of outputGames using the innerHTML attribute for the html tag.
You should retrieve the contents of the games text box and convert it to an integer since the data is a string. You should also retrieve the contents of the teamName text box. This has been done for you already in the html file. I want you to use the number of games from the text box and use a loop to play the number of games. Your team that was entered in the text box will begin at home. Then, your team will switch between being at home and visiting with each iteration of the loop. For example, Game1: home, Game2: visiting, Game3: home, etc. You will still generate random numbers for each of the teams from 0 to 100. However, whomever is the home team will get a 5 point bonus on their score within the loop.  If there is a tie, you will play an overtime that generates a new random number score up to 15 points. This score will be added to the previous score. Do NOT add the extra bonus of 5 points for home teams during the overtime portion. If there is another tie, do another overtime period generating 2 new random numbers and adding it to the total score. Keep doing this until there is no tie. When the game is over you will store the team name and scores for each team and if there was an overtime period. You will show your team name, team score, your opponent’s score, the number of overtime period(s) – don’t display if there wasn’t one, and whether your team won or lost. -->
