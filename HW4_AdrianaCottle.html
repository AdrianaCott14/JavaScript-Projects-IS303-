/* Write a program that prompts the user to enter in a number of teams to work with. Then create an array of the team names which will be gathered from prompts and another array of the team wins which will be random numbers between 0 and 25. Repeat this process for all of the teams. Then search through the array using a FOR Loop to find which team had the most wins. Then print out the team name and the number of their wins. If there is data to display then display all of the teams and their records in a single alert box displaying the team name and the record on one line and then separating each of the team info using the new line character "\n". */
